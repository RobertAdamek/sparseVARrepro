# sparseVARrepro
This repository contains everything necessary to reproduce the simulation results of the paper "Sparse high-dimensional vector autoregressive bootstrap" by Robert Adamek, Stephan Smeekes, and Ines Wilms. 
If you only want to re-run the simulations yourself, we provide a Docker image and instructions how to run it. This method is reproducible regardless of future updates to R or its packages. For transparency, and to make the code useable for other purposes, we also provide the source code used to build the Docker image. 

# How to run the simulations via Docker
The easiest and most reliable way to replicate our simulations is with our Docker image, available for download from https://drive.google.com/file/d/12LdcaW7fsZSH39hU8c-CCfhjWSOZ-3Ge/view?usp=sharing 
The code we provide here is only for transparency, and you do not need to run
